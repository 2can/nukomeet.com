    It has been now more than a year that I work regularly with Alban, requiring his skills on diverse missions related to Wordpress development, web design, SEO, online identity, social media management, technology consulting and web marketing. He has always been efficient, understanding problems quickly, delivering on time with quality and providing the best service. I would definitely recommend him, for highly abstract problem solving, as well as very down to earth tasks.

    I'd like to thanks Nukomeet again for their diligence in the mission we did together. The result is here and our client is satisfied. For us, the mission went well in general. We really liked Zaiste's availability and his responsiveness. Nothing to complain there. I can't judge the quality of the code but I can say that, first, the expected result was here, and, second, Zaiste was spontaneously solving problems we didn't think about beforehand.

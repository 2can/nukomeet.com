At Nukomeet, we spend a lot of time making estimations, setting up agenda, and
negociating prices, because we take care of framing well a project before it
starts.

Nevertheless, we noticed that some clients had a very clear idea of what they
wanted to spend on a given project.

That’s why we came up with Nukomeet Custom Hack: Let’s invert the roles,*you*
make the quote and set up the agenda.

How does it work? Describe your problem, give us a quote and a deadline, and we
come up with a solution.

If the budget is low, we will come up with quick hacks, and maybe some
do-it-yourself solutions.

If your budget is high, we will propose you a bunch of extras, like hiring
a rock star designer, buying traffic, setting up a social media campaign,
preparing your application to handle loads of traffic, improving its load time,
boosting its SEO...

Recently, we participated (together with our friends from [Jalgos][3]) in "Smart Data Day" organised by [AXA][1] and [HEC Paris][2]. The goal of the meeting was to make five blue chips and eight startups meet to talk about data. Here is our overview.

## Participants

The big guests were five French Blue Chips representing diverse business fields.

* [AXA][1]: Insurance group
* [Orange][4]: Telecom provider
* [Société Génerale][5]: Banking (Corporate and Investment)
* [Renault][6]: Car manufacturer
* [Voyages SNCF][7]: Travels

The startups guest were [Algolia][8], [Data Publica][9], [Dataiku][10], [Dataveyes][11], [Follow Analaytics][12], [Quantstreams][13], [Wisembly][14] and Nukomeet.

## What we learnt

Blue Chips were both interested and concerned about the changes brought by the greater use of data in business. They all knew that the data revolution should not be missed. Those companies were also not as much concerned by existing competitors, but rather by newcomers who could disrupt quickly and deeply their market. What if Google or Facebook started to sell cars, insurances, banking services or travels? It's not only about Google or Facebook, but also about agile startups that can quickly build a disruptive technology.

Another thing that caught our attention were potential synergies between Blue Chips around data. Let's imagine what would mean a connected car's data for a car insurance company, and for the customers...

The Blue Chips were all already investing in internal projects for digital transition with large part specifically dedicated to data. They were present at this event to gather idea, check on what was being done in the startup scene, and eventually find the product, services or set of skills that could help them in that transition process.

## What we think about Data

### What's data science really about

A data scientist can be defined as a person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. Performing data science requires these two sets of skills. This is why we decided to offer the best in both at Nukomeet:

* Technology Edge: We constantly put ourselves at the edge of innovation in Computer Science and Data Management
* Data Science Expertise: We have experts in statistics and data science internally and through our partnership with [Jalgos][3]

### Unicorn Promise

There is data revolution. New tools and technologies allow to treat large amounts of data easier and faster than before. All this did not exist yesterday. We are excited by new possibilities these changes bring. We are looking forward to innovation to be made thanks to data. Data Science is a vast field which core principles remain stable and change slowly.

There are no generic solutions in Data Science nor one set of algorithms or one platform will be able to address in a satisfying way the challenges of Orange's data and AXA's data. And there is no platform today that will be able to transform anybody into a Data Scientist.

### Our approach

Our way to develop and implement Data Science project articulates itself around 4 basic actions:

* __Assess__ your data potential

The first step is to understand what data is available and relevent for you business (both internally and externally). Data audit is supposed to gather all interesting sources that could power your future data tools. This requires to understand both your business and the way data could be used to power it.

* __Shape__ your solution

We then shape the solution that best fits your needs. Our objective is to create the best algorithm(s) to solve your data challenge and to design the most relevent architecture to handle your data.

* __Embrace__ technological diversity

We implement the solution using the tools most adapted to your existing architecture. We do not deliver blackboxes, but rather lightweight solutions that are easy to extend and evolove.

* __Empower__ your teams

Finally, we deeply care about your autonomy. This is why we offer trainings in Data Science, to share with you our expertise and enable you to master the core concepts of data science

title: Software good practices applied to the car industry
---

Lean, Agile, Test-Driven, Scrum, Object-oriented… When I talk about these great working processes that the software industry uses I am often answered that it only works with programmers and code.

There are several examples that prove it wrong. Wikispeed’s distributed team for instance, built a 25,000 dollars 100 mpg car in three months using these methods.

Here are the lessons they took from the software industry, copied [from their website](http://www.wikispeed.com/the-process):

_“From Lean software design we take the concept of using less stuff wherever responsible. This is based on the common-sense mandate to “use less stuff,” which is then defined in a clear, applicable way by the contemporary software team._

_From Extreme Programming (XP) we take the practices of pairing and swarming. These practices date back at least as far as the apprentice model but have been carefully defined to replace the need for most types of training and process documentation._

_From Agile software development we take the principle of reducing cost to make change—changes in team, materials, machinery, and even goals._

_From Scrum software development we take clearly defined team roles and responsibilities, which allows us to spend more time rapidly developing product with no nonworking (management only) roles and only two meetings._

_From Test-Driven Development we start with failing tests and then develop solutions. This allows us to quickly identify if current work is not targeted to pass a test or is causing problems elsewhere in the system, which avoids waste._

_From Object-Oriented Programming we take Contract-First Development, which enables the modularity of the WIKISPEED car and all of our solutions.”_

The team compressed the entire development cycle into one-week “sprints, from twenty four years in the car industry.

Here is an infography about the results:

Another interesting thing with Wikispeed is the fact that the project is public, you can see their dashboard with what has to be done and what was done here And it is open, anyone can join and contribute. They define themselves as a team of volunteers with “equitable distribution of wealth” as their first principle.

Polygrammers is the name we use to designate polyglot programmers, _those who dare to use more than
programming language._

Last Tuesday, we had our first [Polygrammers
event](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1391326964415498/) in Paris. There was
really a few people but still, we enjoyed the great opportunity to meet [Ianis
Lallemand](http://www.ianislallemand.net/) who I like to call an artist developer even if he might disagree with this appellation. But anyway, he has strong interests in development, music and art and he is good at it. My call.

It was great meeting him, hearing from him about his different works like [one he
exposed in London](http://www.ianislallemand.net/works/graphite/) or the [one
near to Paris](http://www.ianislallemand.net/works/acclrtr/).

I invite you to read more about his work on [his
website](http://www.ianislallemand.net/works/).

Also if you're near to Poznan in Poland, you should go meet our fellow Polish friends the July
30th. More informations on the [FB
Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/143211512550582/).

I'm looking forward to organize more Polygrammers meeting to meet more awesome
people so [join us!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1391326964415498/)

![ParisHackers Meetup](/assets/images/porn.jpg "ParisHackers Meetup")We went last night to the excellent ParisHacker meetup, where we had the luck to hear Michel Bartz talk about performance in a high traffic environment. Michel knows about the topic as he was Lead Software Engineer at Pornhub for four years. 

It was fascinating to hear about it in terms of video streaming (5 billions per month), bandwith (100 Gigabytes per second), technologies (PHP, MySQL, Redis...) and technical challenges. We are not used to consider porn businesses as a technology firm, but they actually are. Pornhub is the biggest video streaming platform in the world after Youtube. They host 350 Terabytes of video - that's a lot of porn, but also a lot of interesting problems to solve.  

I will leave you with his answer to someone who asked if there were any VCs investing in porn. "I am not allowed to disclose any figure, but in four year at the company, reading Techcrunch talking about start-up raising capital, I never heard about a start-up raising the equivalent of what we raised."

This simple quote lets us imagine what is at stake in a field of the net business that we tend to overlook...

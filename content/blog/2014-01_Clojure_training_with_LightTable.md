We are happy to announce [Clojure][3] training in the city of POZnan. It will happen
on February 23th.

The workshop will be 1 days long. We will present the basics concepts and
techniques of the language; it will be oriented towards programmers new to
functional programming.

The attendence is free of charge, but we have only 10 spots available - if there
is more people interested, we will choose them randomly. You can subscribe for
the workshop at [nukomeet.com/workshops][4]

During the course we will be using [LightTable][1], a brand new, general purpose
[IDE that gives coding superpowers to everyone][2].

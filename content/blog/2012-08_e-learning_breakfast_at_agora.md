The [Khan Academy][]. [Udacity][]. [Coursera][]. Only recently,
education seems to have discovered the internet. Online courses are
massively being created. The big universities like [MITx][] start
joining the game. Clearly, learning is changing on a bigger scale.

For IT people, however, online university courses are only a
manifestation of what we have been practicing for years. Learning a
programming language from online content instead of a lecture seems to
have been common practice almost forever. Admittedly, with services like
[Codeacademy][] it is becoming nicer.

What is new, then? For instance, gamification is. Online tools like
[memrise][] help learning vocabulary. [Fold.it][] implemented the 3D
models of biomolecules as a game. [Socrative][] takes gamification on
mobile devices and straight into the classroom.

What do these developments mean? How will the role of the teacher
change? What e-learning tools are we yet to see? How does the future of
analog teaching look like? What is there that online learning cannot
achieve?

**On August 15th at 10:00 we would like to gather ideas on e-learning
over breakfast at [Agora][].**

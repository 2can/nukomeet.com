Flat companies and organizations already have a long history. [W. L. Gore
& Associates][1], [Valve][2], [Github][3] and many others have their own form of flat
organization, depending on their size and activity.

Nukomeet also being [flat][4] - which matters a lot to us as you may know - we were
happy to organize last week together with [Mutinerie][5], [Hensen][6] and [Open Initiative][7],
a conference on this topic.

We had the pleasure to listen to speakers with different background and
experience and sharing their own vision of what is - and how you make - a flat
organization.

### This is what we remember the most

### Eric Laurent

Eric Laurent told us about how he brought transparency, cross-domain relevance
and immediacy in a firm well known for being heavily hierarchical: La Poste.
He presented the points that are, according to him, mandatory to any flat
organization.
Sharing a common interest stays in our minds as the most important one.
Diversity of experience, mindsets and skills is important for creativity and
efficiency, but the common interest - and thus goals - remains necessary for
a flat team to perform.

### Christophe Baillon

CEO of [Sogilis][8], a high-end boarded software development company, Christophe and his partner
decided to embrace the flat model with another particularity: the cell
organization. He decided to divide his teams in specialized, flat and autonomous
cells of 6-7 people (the board being one cell among others). Apart from
respecting three goals - profitability, client satisfaction and happiness - each
cell is totally free to make the choices they want and to work (or not work) the
way they decide to.

Why 6 to 7 people ? For Christophe, “a well-sized team is when it is possible to
share a pizza”. Well, I guess it depends on the [size of the pizza][9].

### Jean-Noël Chaintreuil

Coming from the HR world of big traditional companies, Jean-Noël joined
[Digidust][10], flat-organized strategy and social media consulting company.
He underlined the fact that making coworkers more autonomous and responsible is
a key to unveiling everyone’s skills and creativity, to make the organization
more efficient and people in it happier. He was also convinced - from his
experience in HR and flat organization - that contrary to the usual opinion,
being flat is not only for a certain elite of very autonomous people but that
anyone can fit and be happy in such a team.
To a question about how to manage difficult personality, Jean-Noël shared that
in a well organized company, the diva type was actually a wonderful asset.

Many other interesting questions have been raised, from how to hire people to
why religious organizations are not - or are they? - flat, along with the story
of a CEO saving his company by leaving it - or was it God?
Stay tuned if you want the next updates on flat and how we are trying, here at
Nukomeet, to invent the future of work!

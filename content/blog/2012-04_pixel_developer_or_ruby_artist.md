title: "Pixel developer or Ruby artist ?"
---

This is the story odpososff **≈Åukasz** - better known in the internet society by his pseudonym **ofca**.

**Ofca** had always wanted to be a graphic designer. Since the beginning of his studies his whole world was composed by web layouts, logos and business cards. 

But one day he discovered a new passion that changed everything. Some dark forces called Ruby On Rails called his soul. They were possessing him like a daemon and he began to program more and more. He dived so much into RoR realm that it nearly destroyed his life ;)

Today, **ofca** is working and learning awesome stuff from [Nukomeet](http://nukomeet.com) folks while at the same time developing his original-skills as a graphic designer. Together with his brother they achieved an old-school-looking pixel platform flash game named **Terry Poorflyer** and are already making another one, this time for **Android** platform. 

You can call him hesitant - can one really try to be a graphic designer and a ruby developer at the same time? It is hard to be good in both such different things. _Everything is possible_ - he says, _but don't cheat yourself - nothing will just come itself - try hard and learn from the best_.
Here at Nukomeet, we believe this is the kind of talents that will shape the future. Polyvalent, creative & weird people are the best at innovating. We like folks who are eager to learn, rather than people who think they know everything and just want to use what they know. Welcome **Ofca**!

I have been interested in brain and neuroscience for a long time now, teaching myself through [books](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFundamental-Neuroscience-Fourth-Edition-Squire%2Fdp%2F0123858704&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGxS8TwhBuelXDCvSzJ9U-S6XoZ0w), building on my previous scientific background. But I actually never had the chance to experience brain/computer interface in action in real life yet. Until this week, when Alban and I headed to the San Francisco [TechShop](http://www.techshop.ws/tssf.html) to attend an event organized by Masahiro Kahata and Brent Thorne about controlling objects with brain waves through an arduino.

In the conference room, five people were listening to a man with a japanese accent who was wearing a headband barely hiding electrodes on his forehead. The man’s head was wired to what looked like an arduino and a computer, and plenty of LED and objects were flashing on the table while a mesmerizing visualization was projected on a big screen.

The animation looked like a visualization of a landscape’s relief that we’d be overflying. It was obviously the amplitude of brain waves depending on their frequency (from 0 to 120 Hz, which is an original scale for brainwave study, usually focused on lower frequencies), with some time persistence for a better experience. One was reacting to the front left electrode, one to the front right, and one in the middle was showing the degree of coherence between the two.

Masahiro was the creator of the technology demonstrated, both hard and software parts, and told us this was the result of 30 years of work. We only had a glimpse of what seemed possible with the tool, and I encourage you to learn more about his work on his [page](http://www.psychiclab.net/IBVA/Profile.html).

The most exciting part was still to happen: we got to try the tool, thus visualizing our own brain waves in real time, trying to control them and play with them, through relaxation, excitation and other states of mind - while observing the actual result on brain wave amplitude on the screen, as you can see on the picture.

This kind of biofeedback (even if some noise, particularly from forehead muscle activity was a bit annoying) is a wonderful experience in itself, on artistic, intellectual and spiritual dimensions at the same time. It reminded me of a recent [study](http://news.yale.edu/2013/05/07/research-news-real-time-brain-feedback-can-help-people-overcome-anxiety) by the University of Yale showing that observing your own brain waves helped controlling adverse emotions and feeling and created new neural connection in the related parts of the brain.


The best of all (not talking about the fact that anyone can make the hardware and use Masahiro software?) Masahiro and Brent are working on a new, more efficient design that should be released in a few months. You should keep an eye on them, as brain/computer interface and thus brain wave analysis are among the next big things, with as many applications as you can imagine, including password replacement, induced meditation or sleep, control over connected objects, wordless communication etc.

This was the best excuse ever for skipping my daily meditation routine.

At Nukomeet, we use GitHub for active private projects and for open-source projects.

The thing is GitHub plans make you pay more as you have private projects but nobody wants to pay for private dead/inactive/over projects. So we choose to transfer these projects to BitBucket.

# The process

We used to do it by hand but it can get boring fast, especially if you're doing it but you never worked on any of these projects.

You'll have to clone it, create a repository in BitBucket, push your project on BitBucket and delete the project from GitHub.

Recently, I had to do this for 5 projects the same day so I decided to write a small script that would do most of the job for me.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/AdrienGiboire/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/archive_github_repo_to_bitbucket.sh).

It is a really basic script which clones your GitHub repositories in `/tmp`, uses BitBucket API to create a repository in your organisation, pushes the former to the latter and removes your local repository to keep your machine clean.

Remember, you will still have to delete the GitHub repositories by yourself.

To read more, read the documentation at the top of the script.

extract: From January 17 to 19, I participated in a Google Glass hackathon organized by GlassCamp in Paris. It was an almost 40 hours long event with 5 teams in competition. Google Glass is still a very obscure technology - it’s difficult to get the device and get familiar with its SDK. There are about 20 glass devices in France (8 of them were used at the event).

From January 17 to 19, I participated in a Google Glass hackathon organized by [GlassCamp][1] in Paris. It was an almost 40 hours long event with 5 teams in competition. Google Glass is still a very obscure technology - it’s difficult to get the device and get familiar with its SDK. There are about 20 glass devices in France (8 of them were used at the event).

I had the pleasure to be a part of the BikeFinder team. The idea was to create an application that shows bikes disponibility in cities that have such service e.g. Velib in Paris (check [the video][5] that explains the concept). My task was to develop a backend for this application. At the end of the event we managed to deliver a fully operational application that works in any city where JC Decaux data about public bicycles is available.

Our solution won the competition. The jury was impressed by the fact that the application was fully usable at the end of the hackathon and that we managed to easily interface with other cities e.g. Barcelona where we had even some beta testers.

If you like the concept, be sure to like it [on Facebook][3] and/or follow us [on Twitter][4].

We had the luck last week to attend to San Francisco Makerfaire, a big fair that showcases a diversity of passionate people under the unique label of “maker”. You could find there burning man aficionados with fire machines, war vets with mechanical dragons, 3D printer hackers, drone builders, as well as model train enthusiasts, school teachers, Stanford PHDs, brain musicians, permaculture prophets and so on.

We brought three insights for you from this stimulating chaos:

**If you are thinking about arriving on the market with a new commercial 3D printer, think again**

We were surprised by the number and diversity  of offers for 3D printers. It seems like every kid in the area is starting a 3D printer company. One remark though, they were all using the same material and technique, which have their flaws.

**Drones are cool**

There was a drone showcase and competition, and we were impressed by what we’ve seen. The one I liked most was one with the size of an arduino board, with a camera on it, that was linked to a kind of gaming eyewear / headset.

**Consumer friendly Brain Computer Interfaces are coming soon**

After making concerts with our brains at a stand, we went playing with the Neurosky Mindwave Mobile. It’s simple and cheap. Even though the signal could be improved and the apps available are scarce, it already opens a lot of opportunities.

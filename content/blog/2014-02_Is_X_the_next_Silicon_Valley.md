#### TL;DR
Focus on your unique strengths, stop looking up to SV and start doing business
on your own rules whenever you are based.

Nomadism is one of our core values here at Nukomeet. We don’t have offices (yes,
we know, it’s *très à la mode* these days) and we constantly travel around the
world.

In early 2013 we lived in San Francisco for a couple of months. Since that time
we have this strange feeling that « being next Silicon Valley » mantra is
pursuing us. Wherever we go, either it’s London, Paris or Berlin
people we meet say that this city is probably the next Silicon Valley. [What does
it mean?][4]

Now, we just got back from a short trip to Bratislava. We participated in
a nicely organized [Dart Meetup][1] at [The Spot][2] and couples of beers with
[Rubyslava][3] folks - and who knows?! maybe Bratislava is also the next Silicon
Valley.

Our next trip leads us back to San Francisco and to the old Silicon Valley with
a desire that the curse will end where it started. There are many great cities
around the world with amazing tech communities: hopefully each one will soon
become « better » than Silicon Valley in its own, different way.

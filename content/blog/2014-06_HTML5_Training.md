# Workshop about latest trends in Web Development

Recently we did a 2 days long workshop for a large company from the public sector. The client challenged us to provide a concise introduction to latest web trends and practices for their internal software workforce.

We were asked to cover the following topics:

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Responsive Web Design
* JavaScript
* AngularJS
* API REST / Hypermedia
* [Hybrid mobile app][1]

Such defined scope was broad. We decided to focus on practical part first, as nowadays access to resources is easy. We started with a hands-on experience with a couple of simple examples followed by providing direction to meaningful resources. Our goal was to engage attendees to explore discussed concepts after the workshop finishes.

The workshop went really great despite the fact we often only scratched the surface for many concepts. We had a lot of fun doing it. Attendees really liked the practical approach we proposed.

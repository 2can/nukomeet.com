Recently we announced **[Blast][1]** - an offer to help people transform their ideas into reality. In short, it is hackathons inspired way of providing software solution to our clients.

## Where does it come from?

Over the last couple of years, hackathons have taken over the world like a storm. They are events where people with technical, graphical and communication skills form teams to solve a problem and build the best solution in a very short time.

Teams give all they have during one day or up to a week and end the hackathon with a usable software.

And it works. Here are a few examples:

* [WeatherSafe][2], [an article telling the story][3]
* [BikeFinder][4], [an article about the hackathon by one of us][5]
* [YAKB.us][7], which was developed during [Apps For Communities][8], a called *Civic Hackathon*
* [Homeless SCC][9]
* [Asana][10] uses to develop new functionalities via internal hackathons
* [Facebook][6]'s Like button was conceived as part of a hackathon
* etc.

Here at Nukomeet, we love this form that combines efficacy, speed and high quality results, which is all a launching startup need to get on tracks.

This is why we decided to offer our skills to people who need a quick and running prototype to have their startup project take a first step in the real world.

With our **[Blast][11]** offer, you will get in a week a sound base to start showing results, build your user base, pitch and challenge your idea and plan the next steps in a very efficient way.

## How does it work

The typical case is:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60px"><strong>Day 1</strong></td><td>We discuss to know as best as possible your product idea</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60px"><strong>Day 3</strong></td><td>Together, we list the functionalities your prototype will include</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60px"><strong>Day 3</strong></td><td>After what, either the amount of work fits in our human being capabilities and we get started right at that moment (or the day after :))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center"><strong>OR</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60px"><strong>Day 3</strong></td><td>Otherwise, with our help, you decide the priorities (ie. you give up on some functionalities that are not the most important for this first step) until the amount of work fetch our human being capabilities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60px"><strong>Day 4</strong></td><td>And then, we get started</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

And the next monday, or so, you get your prototype up and running.

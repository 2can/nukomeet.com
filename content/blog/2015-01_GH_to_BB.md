GitHub plans make you pay more as you have private projects but nobody wants to pay for private inactive projects. So we choose to transfer these projects to BitBucket.

We used to do it by hand but in order to gain time, we automated the process.

It is a script that clones your GitHub repositories in `/tmp`:

    cd /tmp
    git clone git@github.com:$github_organisation/$repository.git 2> /dev/null

Then, using BitBucket API, it creates a repository in your organisation:

    curl -X POST -v \
  	 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  	 -u $bitbucket_username:$bitbucket_password \
	 https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/$bitbucket_organisation/$repository \
	 -d '{"scm": "git", "is_private": "true"}' \
	 2> /dev/null

When BitBucket is ready to receive your code, the script pushes your GitHub repository:

    git push git@bitbucket.org:$bitbucket_organisation/$repository.git master

And finally, it removes your local repository to keep your machine clean:

    cd /tmp
    rm -fr $repository

Remember, you will still have to delete the GitHub repository by yourself.

You can find the full script [here](https://github.com/AdrienGiboire/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/archive_github_repo_to_bitbucket.sh).

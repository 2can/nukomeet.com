Since a long time, we know see more and more models built around flat structure.
From [W. L. Gore & Associates](http://www.gore.com/) to
[Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) or [Github](https://github.com) and many
more, from really different sizes, activities and all, each of those one
created its own form of flat organisation.

As you might already know, Nukomeet also is [flat](http://nukomeet.com/about/)
so it's a something that really matters to us.

And so, last week, with [Mutinerie](http://www.mutinerie.org/),
[Hensen](http://hensen.fr/) and [Open Initiative](http://openinitiative.com/),
we organized a conference about flat organization, like
[our](http://nukomeet.com/about/).

We had the chance to receive several people from different contexts who went with
specific examples according to their personnal experiences.

Eric Laurent told us about how he brought transparency, cross-domain relevance
and immediacy in a context well known for being heavily hierachical. He mainly
spoke about the main points that are mandatory to any flat organization.

The first and probably the most important: **a common interest**. In an
organization, you want different persons with different personnality and
different abilities. At Nukomeet, we think this is where the innovation comes
from. But for a flat organization to work, everyone must share the same
interest.

Eric told us to also care about cross-domain relevance, immediacy, communication
in order to make everybody independent and transparency.

Christophe Baillon is the CEO of Sogilis, a software development company, who
brought a new flat model. He decided to divide his teams in cells of 6-7 people.
All his company (even the direction, administrative and marketing area) are
composed in/of cells. In each cell, all people are _equals_ but there is still
one member in each cell who is designed by his pairs as a _captain_, which role
is mainly to link with the other cells.

Each cell has 3 important missions. They have to satisfy the client, of course,
achieve a sufficient turnover in order to be sure to pay wages, and create
a positive work atmosphere. Everything else is left to the will of the cells.
They decide their goals and how to achieve them.

The human resources cell, the direction and the marketing cells are indicated as
facilitator in order to help _operational_ cells to be free and achieve in
a better atmosphere their goal.

He also told us that the critical size of a cell is when it's not anymore
possible to share a pizza. Well, I guess it depends on the
[size](http://melbournepizzadelivery.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Worlds-Largest-Pizza.jpg) [of the](http://www.incrediblethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/worlds-largest-pizza-2.jpg) [pizza](http://www.pizzadelivery.org/Portals/0/ContentImages/largest-pizza-in-south-africa.jpg).

This man has well known the big traditional companies' organization before
willing to instore horizontal organisation.

Working in Digidust, he told us they look to emerge everybody skills by
confronting differences.

# Conclusion

That was a nice evening. I got the occasion to met a few people, not yet enough
:) I think that's a thing that deserves to be reproduced. If that's something
that interest you, [let us know](mailto:bonjour@nukomeet.com).

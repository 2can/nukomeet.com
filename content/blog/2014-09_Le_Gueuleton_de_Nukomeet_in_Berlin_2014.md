Berlin")

It’s already our tradition that few times a year entire Nukomeet team physically meets together to see each other, to exchange and to celebrate our cooperation. It’s a wonderful way to rejoice and to integrate especially as we often don’t see each other on a regular basis, working mainly in a remote manner.

After San Francisco and Paris this summer we have chosen the beautiful city of Berlin for our social gathering.  Berlin is an exciting and a stimulating place, especially for people working in tech industry.

At this reunion we met with Adam for the first time. We spent hours walking around and exploring the city, talking mostly about the future and about the role and the importance of the technology in today’s world.

« Gueuleton » is a word in French for a superb celebration. This social event is of great importance for us. It is an extremely efficient way to fuel our energy and provides a wonderful balance between work and fun in our business endevaour.

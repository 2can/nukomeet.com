description: "What if students and children translated Wikipedia in their language lessons"
---

Did you notice that some articles in Wikipedia are much better in a language than in others? 
Did you know that millions of children and students spend hours translating texts to learn foreign languages? 
Did you realize that this is a pain for the teachers to find interesting and stimulating texts for their students to translate? 

What if they translated Wikipedia articles? 

This is not only about translating Wikipedia, it is also about transmitting the wiki culture to children:
Learn to build the knowledge instead of receiving it from others.
Learn collaboration in class, instead of competition
Learn to verify your sources and question them. 

Wikipedia has become the main cheatsheet for most of students and children in the recent years. 
What if they understood its mechanism, its beauty and its imperfections? 
What if they participated in it to correct its mistakes instead of copy-pasting them? 

To make this happen we just need one thing : have the teachers understand and implement it.
Just share this page with the people you know so that it reaches the teachers.
If you have a blog, just copy paste and reblog it.

We would like to introduce you to a new approach on how to work together and make a living, as an alternative to traditional companies. It's an early draft, but we decided to publish it anyway in order to get feedback.

From the beginning we didn't want to create a traditional company, being rather unsatisfied with existing models. We wanted to change that, to innovate it that field with a quite simple goal in mind: *how to make people happy at work?* as we profoundly believe that happy people are far more creative and productive, and such configuration makes *work* a very different concept.

Nukomeet is about programmers that are passionate about their craft. Our approach can be summarized in six core principles:

**0. We understand code.**

These days software companies are launched by various types of people. Quite often entrepreneurs are not familiar with core concepts of the field; they are rather interested in getting fast profits; technology is considered as an easy way to gain a lot of money in a short span of time. We think this is wrong, and that the future technology entrepreneurs will be mostly represented by programmers. Programming is a fundamental concept that should be fully embraced if technology is involved. We tend to think that code is the modern latin, it glues everything in the technology field. For that reason we decided that every member of Nukomeet crew should be able to program.

**1. We are transparent.**

How many times communication bottlenecks led you to failure ? How many times a process to obtain a piece of information was too cumbersome in order to be efficient ? How many resources is spent to keep things secret ? Wouldn't it be easier to build an open, transparent company culture where sharing all information is not only allowed, but also encouraged and rewarded.

**2. We are fair.**

The profit is shared, kept or invested according to the will of the people in the company.

**3. We are equal.**

We think hierarchies belong to another age. What is more, we believe that the workers, those who create the value, should take decisions. Because it is fair, and because it is natural - they know what is at stake as well or even better than managers.

**4. We trust each other.**

Trust is a crucial element to establish a great company culture. For us, a company moves forward only if everyone cares about. We don't hire people who don't care about the company, who believe it is *their* company.
Therefore, we refuse to do micro-management. People work when they want, where they want, as they want. We assess only results.

**5. We innovate.**

The mission for Nukomeet is to become a innovation agency where people can start and grow their projects, using company resources if needed. We want to create an adapted environment for innovation.

That's is our way. Please tell us what you think about it, what's wrong and what's good in it.

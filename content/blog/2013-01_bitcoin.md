Considering the recent surge of online services, like
[Coinbase](http://coinbase.com) or [Bitpay](http://bitpay), that
make the transfer and storage of Bitcoin easier and safer, we've decided that
we will now accept payments in Bitcoin (never heard of Bitcoin? [Head
there](http://weusecoins.com).

A few reasons why:
It is safer than credit card payment
We don't the rates applied by banks and Paypal are fair
We like the idea of using the fruit of a open source distributed software as
a mean of payment.

title: "Let's crowdsource a mobile app for Seth Godin !"
---

Yesterday, [Seth Godin][1] [announced on his blog][2] that he would like to provide his readers with a mobile application for a better reading experience. [Nukomeet team members][3] are huge fans of Seth’s writings, we like a lot his insights about marketing and business in general.

His texts carry a lot of value for many people, still Seth keeps this knowledge free. We decided to help spreading it on the Internet, and instead of creating a closed application, leverage Seth’s fans community: let’s crowdsource this mobile application for Seth Godin as a way of saying thank you.

We just [published the source code on Github][10], it's a first version of this mobile application. It is also [available online on Heroku][11], you can bookmark it and use it right away on your mobile device. It can serve as a basis for further development. It’s just a rough scaffold for a non-native mobile app, written using open source technologies [Node.js][4] and [jQuery Mobile][5]. Conceptually, this is very simple, RSS reader is not a rocket science, in the end. We think to integrate it with [PhoneGap][6] in order to deploy it on many devices at once, so it’s easier to use for readers. Next step would be to focus on UX/UI. If you can help with that, [contact us][7].

We hope that a beautiful mobile application will emerge as a result of this collaborative effort. Pull request are welcome! We also hope Seth will like this initiative.

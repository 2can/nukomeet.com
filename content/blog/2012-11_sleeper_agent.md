title: Introducing the Sleeper Agent Program
---

We don't have any salesmen at Nukomeet, yet we have clients. Even though we spend some time answering to job boards and requests for proposals, we noticed that most of the project that we actually end up doing come from friends that recommended our work.

Being recommended seems more important than knowing [what we do](http://nukomeet.com/projects) or browsing [our code](http://github.com/nukomeet). Therefore, we decided to give more impetus to friend recommendation by formalizing and rewarding it.

Here comes the sleeper agent program.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_agent), ”A sleeper agent is a spy who is placed in a target country or organization, not to undertake an immediate mission, but rather to act as a potential asset if activated. Sleeper agents are popular plot devices in fiction, in particular espionage fiction and science fiction.”

Being a Nukomeet sleeper agent means to continue leading your life, don't change anything to your habits, except when you meet someone that needs a website, a mobile application, or has an awesome project related to the internet. Then you become an active agent, with one and only one super important mission :

*You don't bargain anything, you don't sell anything, you just put us in touch with the potential client. That's it*.

If things go well and we are contracted by your contact, we give back 10% of the value of the first contract signed.

To help you with your mission, you can join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/272379212864411/), [download](http://nukomeet.com/assets/images/nucard.jpg) and print a template of a business card. You're allowed to change it, make it fun or pink (and send us your best design).

Is it legal? Of course, you would have the status of apporteur d'affaire under the French law and be paid once the contract is finished, paid, and that we receive your bill. 

*"I was glad to recommend Nukomeet and bring them some business because i know
these guys are nice and very good at what they do. Obviously the 10% commission
didn't hurt either :)"*
Says Sebastien, one of our first sleeper agents, who made 875 euros simply by
sending a mail.

Interested? Print your cards and start your mission!

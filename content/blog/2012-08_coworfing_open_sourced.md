Nukomeet team has been working hard during the last monthes to develop [Coworfing]("http://coworfing.com"), an app for nomads - freelancers, entrepreneurs, students and teleworkers - to share the places where they like to work: Cafés, bars, coworking spaces, librairies, airports, parks, and even their own homes.

We are happy to announce that we just released to [source code]("http://github.com/nukomeet/coworfing"). Feel free to play around with it and contribute!

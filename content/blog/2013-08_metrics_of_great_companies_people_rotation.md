People often asks me how I would define a great company. Some would say it's
about earning money, it's business after all. Other would argue it's about
creating a product people need and care about. In eyes of many, best companies
are these who fulfil objectives for its clients and stakeholders in the first
place. While not false, we tend to put  a value on company’s external
appearance. Such defined characteristics should be results of building a great
company as they refer to its performance. It's an internal well-being and
integrity which should produce excellent results, not an intense pressure,
a hard exploitation nor an unfair affinity illusion.

The company essence is people who decided to work together; it's a preliminary
ingredient which is necessary to fulfil the company objectives. Great companies
are those that focus on people. One of my favourite indicators of a great
company is the number of people that left or was fired, I call it « people
rotation metric ». Usually, the lower it stays the better the company seems.
When people leave it's usually company fault: when people expectations diverge,
it's a company responsibility to facilitate and reduce the tension; when people
goals rise, the company must keep up. Once this metric rises its value
considerably, people are not treated as they should - there is something wrong
whether related to pressure, exploitation or the way « together » is perceived.

At Nukomeet, we believe in a lifetime commitment when it comes to forming a work
environment. We set up a flat structure not to make an illusion for decisions
making, but to truly and fully consolidate people within. It is only possible
with an identical chance to act and perform which correspond to a flat and equal
ownership of the company. It's only the work that can make the difference.
There is no other way around, otherwise it's just another golden cage.

And what are your metrics that may define a great company ?

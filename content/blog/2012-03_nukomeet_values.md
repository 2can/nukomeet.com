title: Nukomeet values

Nukomeet is now live. In this blog post we will explain the rationale behind the company.

From the beginning we didn't want to create a traditional company, being rather unsatisfied with existing models. We wanted to change that, to innovate it that field with a quite simple goal in mind: *how to make people happy at work?* as we profoundly believe that happy people are far more creative and productive. Such configuration makes *work* a very different concept. 

Nukomeet is about programmers that are passionate about their craft. Our approach can be summarized by six core principles:

**0. We understand code.**

These days software companies are launched by various types of people. Quite often those who creates them are not familiar with basic, core concepts of the field; they are rather interested in getting fast profits; technology is considered as an easy way to gain a lot of money in a short span of time. We think this is wrong, and that the future technology entrepreneurs will be mostly represented by programmers. Programming is a fundamental concept that should be fully embraced if technology is involved. We tend to think that the code is the modern latin, it glues everything in the technology field. Programming is for us a manifestation how human brain is able to transform repetition or pattern into reusable knowledge. For that reason we decided that every member of Nukomeet crew should be able to program.

**1. We are transparent.**

How many times communication bottlenecks led you to the failure ? How many times a process to obtain a piece of information was too cumbersome in order to be efficient ? How much resources is spent to keep things secret ? and more importantly why within a company realm there are secrets ? Wouldn't it be easier to build an open, transparent company culture where sharing all information is only allowed, but also encouraged and rewarded ? We think that way: Nukomeet has no secrets for its peers.

**2. We are fair.**

When creating software, contributions are easily measurable. Programming is a skill which is not easily replaceable; marketing, business, financial stuff can be easily put « outside the company », sometimes it is even not needed at all. As a programmer is our most important asset we reward them in a fair manner, more pricesely, the profit is shared, kept or invested according to the will of people inside the company.

**3. We are equal.**

We truely hate hierarchies for several reasons. The most important one is that very often people on top are unable to take proper decisions as they aren't the ones who create the value. Various managers mentally move away from the real problems that needs to be solved. When dealing with software, only programming is what matters, other activites have only supportive role

**4. We trust each other.**

The trust is a crucial element to establish a great company culture. For us the company is a vessel that moves forward only if everyone is carring about fact. We refuse to do micro-management. Nukomeeters work when they want, where they want, as they want. We assess only results.

**5. We innovate.**

The mission for Nukomeet is to become a innovation agency where people can start and grow their projects, using company resources if needed. We want to create an adapted enviroement based on the echange of micro-services within the company: an innovation incubator. We think that all managerial / business / marketing « fat » is not only unnecessary to create minimal viable products, but it might be also at some point pretty destructive. Financial resources are not needed to build an awesome product, we think that it is possible only by exchanging and confronting ideas. 

That's is our way. Please tell us what you think.

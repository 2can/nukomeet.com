Nukomeet is now live.

We don't want to create a traditional company. We pretend to innovate, so let's innovate also in our organizational model. Our goal is quite simple - being happy. We believe that happy people are more creative and productive.

We craft applications. Let's call Nukomeet a next-gen software company. Our approach can be summarized by six core principles:

**0. We understand code.**
These days software companies are made by various types of people. Quite often those who creates them are not familiar with basic, core concepts of the field; they are rather interested in getting fast profits; technology is considered as an easy way to gain a lot of money in a short span of time. We think this is wrong, and that the future technology entrepreneurs will be mostly represented by programmers. Programming is a fundamental concept that should be fully embraced if technology is involved. We tend to think that the code is the modern latin, it glues everything in the technology field. So we decided that every member of Nukomeet crew should be able to program.

**1. We are transparent.**
How many times communication bottlenecks led you to the failure ? How many times a process to obtain a piece of information was too cumbersome in order to be efficient ? How much resources is spent to keep things secret ?

**2. We are fair.**
Profit is shared/kept/invested according to the will of haxors.

**3. We are equal.**
We truely hate hierarchies for several reasons. The most important one is that very often people on top are unable to take proper decisions as they aren't the ones who create the value. Various managers mentally move away from the real problems that needs to be solved. 

**4. We trust each other.**
The trust is a crucial element. We refuse to do micro-management. 
Haxors work when they want, where they want, as they want. We assess only results.

**5. We innovate.**
The mission for Nukomeet is to become a innovation agency where people can start and grow their projects, using all company resources if needed. We want to create an adapted enviroement based on the echange of micro-services within the company: an innovation incubator. We think that all managerial / business / marketing « fat » is not only unnecessary to create minimal viable products, but it might be also at some point pretty destructive.

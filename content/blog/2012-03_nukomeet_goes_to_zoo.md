For our first working session together, we crashed at a place named [« the Zoo »](http://www.facebook.com/coworkingZOO), close to the Rondo Kaponiera (or Roda de Capoeira, according to Nukomeet guys). 

The Zoo is a coworking space in a an old mansion looking like a haunted manor. The mansion looks old but it has a pretty fast connexion and it is fully renovated inside – and it even hosts a data center. A nice mix of the latest technologies and picturesque old stones. 

We had a nice chat with Darek, who is charge of the place. He wants to connect coworking center around the world with videoconferencing system that will decorate the walls. Thus, working, you will see people from Tokyo or Sao Paulo coworking. 

It's been a nice day of work, calm and productive. If you ever go by Poznan, Poland, I advise you to check the place.
